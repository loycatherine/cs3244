## My contributions to the CS3244 project, Detecting Cyberbullying in Singapore context

I used the built in NaiveBayes model in scikit-learn, and fastAI's ULMFiT transfer learning model to train on the general dataset, 
which was from Kaggle, and a local dataset, which my team self-sourced from 
many different Singaporean websites, such as STOMP and HardwareZone.
